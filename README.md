[Final Project: Design your Own Grid-Based Framework](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/design-your-own-grid-based-framework)

In this final project, you'll get to take everything you've learned and use it to build your own simple grid-based framework. As with the other final projects, we'll keep it relatively open-ended to give you a chance to exercise your creativity and problem-solving skills. It will be a great project to show off to potential employers as well.


This framework is heavily inspired by bootstrap, but only reproduces the fluid/responsive grid part. 

* 12 column grid.
* Columns defined inside rows, inside containers.
* Nested rows and columns
* 4 different column "size" (xs, sm, md, lg), for responsive behaviour at different breakpoint
* Syntax is "column-md-6"
* CSS reset
* Very basic font styling
